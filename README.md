# LINQ in Manhattan
# Summary:
The provided code is a C# program that demonstrates the use of LINQ (Language Integrated Query) to process data from a JSON file.
It focuses on analyzing neighborhood information in Manhattan. 
The program reads the JSON data, performs various queries and transformations using LINQ, and outputs the results to the console.
 
# Visuals:
As the code runs, it displays the neighborhoods based on different queries, along with the final total count of neighborhoods, to the console.
# Usage
To use the programm do the following : 
- Make sure that you have the necessary prerequisites:

  *  A development environment with C# support (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or any other C# IDE).
  - The Newtonsoft.Json NuGet package should be automatically restored during the build process.
- Clone the repository
- Open the project in the development environment:

- Build the project:

- Obtain the JSON file:

Make sure the "Neighborhoods.json" file with the provided JSON data is included in the project's root folder.
- Run the code:

Run the project in the development environment (e.g., press F5 or use the "Run" command).
The console should display the neighborhoods based on the queries defined in the code.
Each set of neighborhoods will be accompanied by the final total count of neighborhoods.
# Relevant Details:

- The code uses the Newtonsoft.Json library
- The "Neighborhoods.json" file is located in the same directory as the project.
- The code demonstrates both LINQ method syntax and query syntax.
- There are differnt operations on the neighborhood data such as filtering, projection, and distinct .
